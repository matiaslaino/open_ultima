# open_ultima
An open source remake of Ultima 1: First Age of Darkness

This project is the result of my personal goal to better learn SDL and discover newer C++ features, so please keep that in mind when looking at the ugly code!

For compiling (for now) use Visual C++ and targeting C++ 17.

Requires (of course) the original game files, you can get them from GOG.com!

Dependencies:
SDL 2.0.12
SDL TTF 2.0.15
SDL Image 2.0.5

Features implemented:
  - Basic overworld.
  - Super basic dungeon crawling in a single column.
